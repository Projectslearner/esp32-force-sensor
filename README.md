# ESP32 Force Sensor Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a force sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to measure force or pressure. Force sensors are used in various applications such as robotics, industrial automation, and medical devices where precise force measurement is essential.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Force Sensor (e.g., FSR, load cell)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Block diagram


## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Force Sensor to ESP32:**
   - Connect the analog output pin of the force sensor to analog pin 34 (or any available analog pin) on the ESP32.
   - Ensure a stable power supply and common ground (GND) connection between the ESP32 and the force sensor.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 using `Serial.begin()`.
   - Configure the force sensor pin as an input using `pinMode()`.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog voltage from the force sensor using `analogRead()`.
     - Map the analog value to a force value using the `map()` function and a calibration factor.
     - Print the calculated force value to the Serial Monitor in Newtons (N).

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Calibration Factor:** Adjust the `calibrationFactor` based on your specific force sensor's characteristics and the desired unit of measurement (e.g., Newtons, pounds-force).
   - **Sensor Selection:** Choose a force sensor suitable for your application's force range and accuracy requirements.
   - **Power Requirements:** Ensure the ESP32 and force sensor receive adequate power to operate reliably.

## Applications
- **Robotics:** Measure gripping force in robotic grippers and arms.
- **Medical Devices:** Monitor force exerted during medical procedures and treatments.
- **Industrial Automation:** Control mechanisms based on force feedback in manufacturing processes.

## Notes
- **Force Sensor Output:** Analog sensors provide a voltage output proportional to the force applied.
- **Precision:** Calibration ensures accurate force measurements based on the sensor's characteristics and environmental conditions.
